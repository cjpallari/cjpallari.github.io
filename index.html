      <h1>Assignment 2</h1>
      <p>
        After a shaky start to the year, the San Francisco Giants currently sit
        at
        <strong>66-66</strong>, which puts them <strong>12.5</strong> games out
        of the division lead in the National League West. While their hopes of
        winning the division are essentially gone, they still have a chance to
        buy a ticket to the dance via the Wild Card. With a
        <strong>surplus</strong> of veteran talent (particularly in their
        starting pitching rotation) they could prove to be a
        <strong>scary</strong> team to face in a playoff series.
